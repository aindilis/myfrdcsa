>&#13;	There  are several  different types  of software  systems that
	MyFRDCSA has to  deal with effectively.  At this  time Thu Jan
	29 21:47:19 EST 2004,  there are: {locally developed software,
	existing debian packages,  other system packages, and upstream
	software} Of  upstream software, we would  like to distinguish
	based on license type.  We  figure, if we've found the system,
	and if  it checks  out as being  worthwhile, we would  like to
	make  its  functionality  available.   If  it is  able  to  be
	packaged  for  Debian  immediately,  great.   If  it  contains
	licensing  problems we  will  research these  and contact  the
	appropriate groups  to determine  if they can  relicense their
	software  to be  free.  If  it cannot  be relicensed,  we will
	engage  in a  legal  method  of attempting  to  create a  free
	version   of  it,   where   possible.   If   it  is   licensed
	restrictively, we will probably keep it on record but will not
	redistribute it.  We  will attempt if possible to  apply it to
	the cause of free software,  a necessary evil.  But of course,
	we will always  try to follow the policy  that has made Debian
	among the purest and most capable systems available.
