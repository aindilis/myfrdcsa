    The MyFRDCSA system implements our ontology of software, in
    addition to being a leading project which coordinates other
    projects.  Its role is mainly conceptual at this point as the key
    ontology systems are not yet in place.  Currently it uses an
    OO-Perl architecture which represents projects and systems, and
    provides functionality that is too general for any of the current
    subsystems.
