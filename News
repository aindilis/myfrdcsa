Conversed with people (unfortunately).   Came up with possibile worlds
argument.  Imagine two worlds, where  in one case, a person chooses to
not do one thing.  Then,  comparing these worlds, obviously the person
wishes they were in the world  in which they had indeed made the right
choice.  So, the goal is to make the right choice.

Also came up with best design yet for SVRE.

Added a  really hackish automatic  indexing of documentation,  just so
that there is a  convienient way for me to see what  I am writing, and
for others to see it.
